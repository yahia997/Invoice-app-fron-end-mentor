# Invoice app
This challenge is from fornt-end mentor with hardness "GURU", I enjoied working on this project as it teached me alot, it contains lots of common big websites features:

- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser wiht loacalStorage
